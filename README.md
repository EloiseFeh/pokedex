# Hi, this is my PokeDex Project

## About this project

Like so many Zillenials, I had a lot of fun watching Pokémon as a child. My favorite movie was Pokémn 2000 and I played a lot of roms with a GBA Emulator. I'm glad something I enjoy was able to teach me something <3

## How to start

As soons as you clone the project, use the following commands in your terminal

### Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

#### Notes

Unfortunately, I was not able to apply a mobile friendly interface in this version, but it will be done in a future commit! Thank you all!
